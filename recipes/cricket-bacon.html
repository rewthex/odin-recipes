		<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>30g Ready to Cook Dried Crickets</li>
			<li>20g smoked garlic</li>
			<li>20g smokey bacon seasoning (vegan)</li>
			<li>4 egg yolks</li>
			<li>100g Parmesan (grated)</li>
			<li>200g spaghetti</li>
			<li>25g butter</li>
			<li>1 pack flat leaf parsley (chopped)</li>
			<li>Olive oil</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>METHOD</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>SEASON CRICKETS | 5mins</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Add the crickets, smoked garlic, 1tbsp olive oil and smokey bacon
					seasoning to a mixing bowl and stir to coat. In a separate bowl mix
					the grated Parmesan and the egg yolks together to form a paste.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>BOIL PASTA | 10mins</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the spaghetti, cook
					for 10 mins or until al dente. Once cooked reserve 5 ladles of the
					pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>FRY CRICKETS | 5mins</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In a frying pan melt the butter with a dash of olive oil, once it’s
					hot and foaming add the crickets and fry for 3-5 minutes until the
					crickets are nice and crunchy - be careful not to burn!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>MIX & SERVE | 10mins</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Once the crickets are cooked add the al dente spaghetti to the pan and
					stir to coat. To help keep the pasta moist add two ladles of the pasta
					water and bring to the boil.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then stir in the egg and Parmesan mix until the cheese melts and the
					pasta is well coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more
					of the pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce - the water will
					continue to evaporate on the plate so better have it slightly wet than
					too dry.
				</li>
				<li>Stir through the chopped parsley and serve.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
